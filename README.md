# VATRates Discontinued 

This package has been discontinued. Please find an alternative source for your EU VAT rates.

My reasons are similar to why [jsonvat.com was discontinued](https://github.com/adamcooke/vat-rates):

> The work required to keep such a database up to date is too much for me to handle solo. It should be up to the European Union to provide this service rather than an individual like me.

Apologies for any inconveinence this may cause.
